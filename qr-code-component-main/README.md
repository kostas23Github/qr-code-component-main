### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The tip of the project is that if you want to center the root div element vertically add these commands to the body element:
```
display: flex;
flex-orientation: column;
justify-content: center;
```

### Continued development

Add some animations, more interactivity.
